## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2016

### Day 1: Monday 17/04/2018

**Today's Progress**: Returned to the FreeCodeCamp project *Build a Wikipedia Viewer*. Fixed the api call so that it now works correctly and display results in a list on the page. Spent around 1.5 hours today.

**Thoughts:** Feel rusty and lacking confidence but happy to have the api call working, which was my stumbling block when I last worked on this project.
