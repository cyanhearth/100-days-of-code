## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: Tuesday 17/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Returned to the FreeCodeCamp project *Build a Wikipedia Viewer*. Fixed the api call so that it now works correctly and display results in a list on the page. Spent around 1.5 hours today.

**Thoughts:** Feel rusty and lacking confidence but happy to have the api call working, which was my stumbling block when I last worked on this project.

### Day 2: Wednesday 18/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Around 2 hours on Wikipedia Viewer. Prettied up the list with CSS transitions and put in full info.

**Thoughts:** Not as much as I hoped to finish but I have made some progress at least. Frustrated trying to center unordered list on the page.

### Day 3: Thursday 19/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Centered list successfully. Changes to CSS and optimised layout for mobile phone screens.

**Thoughts:** Tired after work and didn't get a lot done. Need to better plan out what I want to achieve.

### Day 4: Friday 20/04/18

**Today's Progress**: More Wikipedia Viewer. Played with CSS, and trying to change behaviour for mobile.

**Thoughts:** Hit a wall and now I'm confusing myself a bit. Time to leave it for today.

### Day 5: Saturday 21/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished behaviour for mobile screens, so now the css transition will show before you can follow the link, rather than the previous behaviour where the link would open in a new tab before the description is shown.

**Thoughts:** Glad I made time to work on this after a long day. Pretty happy with the result and I think I'm ready to move onto something else.

### Day 11: Friday 27/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Began working through Intermediate Algorithm Scripting on freecodecamp. Trying to make use of functional programming features such as filter function. Had difficulty figuring out why .every() worked in returning the correct value but .forEach() wouldn't. Think I have it figured now but need more work on understanding scope in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Need to stop being hard on myself if something doesn't click right away / I don't immediately find the solution. Part of learning is failing and trying another way.

### Day 12: Saturday 28/04/18

**Today's Progress**: More Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. Enjoying working out the problems using functional programming techniques (functions like filter, reduce, map etc.).  

**Thoughts:** Getting to grips with functional programming. 2 weeks down. I think I didn't really expect to get this far, so this is awesome.

### Day 23: Wednesday 09/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Final 4 problems on Advanced Algorithm Scripting done and made a start to the Javascript Calculator project. Got a calculate function already ~~but does not follow proper order of operations yet.~~ now follows order of operations. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot more time today and accomplished a lot compared to the last few days. Pleased with today.

### Day 24: Thursday 10/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Completed calculate function and it now evaluates operations in the correct order and properly accounts for nested brackets. Built the calculator display and animated the buttons. Now need to finish implementing onclick behaviour for the buttons.

**Thoughts:** Calculator app is turning out pretty nice. I hoped to finish it before going back to work on Saturday and I think I'm on track to do it.

### Day 25: Friday 11/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the calculator. Implemented button behaviour and spent time looking for bugs and edge cases, then dealt with them the best I could.

**Thoughts:** Finishing touches to apps like this are always the most tedious part for me, but I'm quite pleased with the results. I have no doubt that I'll have missed something obvious though!

### Day 26: Saturday 12/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Found and fixed a bug in calculator that caused the history to display incorrectly after starting a new calculation with the result of the previous one. Briefly started to plan out the Pomodoro Clock project and signed up for a CSS design course. Other than that spent a short time on Javascript Udemy course before work.

**Thoughts:** Need to better plan my coding time into my day now that I'm back at work.

### Day 27: Sunday 13/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Got an hour of Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts in before work.

### Day 29 - 31: Tuesday 15/05/18 - Thursday 17/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Most time spent on Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts. Got a good start on Pomodoro Clock today.

**Thoughts:** Will try to go through CSS course concurrently with the Pomodoro Clock as I want it to look impressive.

### Day 32: Friday 18/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Spent too much time setting up Visual Studio Code. Started How to Make Pure CSS Images to Progress With Design-Focused Frontend Development course to get some CSS practice and inspiration for Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts:** Can feel my motivation slipping. Need to refocus.

### Day 33: Saturday 19/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Most time spent trying to get Gulp and Sass set up properly with VS Code. Some more video content from CSS images course.

### Day 34: Monday 21/05/18

**Today's Progress**: Ended up taking a day off so back to it today. Worked out the issue with Gulp (a misplaced gulpfile.js) and fixed it quickly. More time on CSS course and followed through a tutorial making an image of a diamond. Made some of my own changes for practice.

**Thoughts:** I was annoyed at myself for missing a day but looking at the last couple of days it looks like I need to refocus my efforts instead of switching development environments etc on a whim.
