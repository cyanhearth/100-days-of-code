## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: Tuesday 17/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Returned to the FreeCodeCamp project *Build a Wikipedia Viewer*. Fixed the api call so that it now works correctly and display results in a list on the page. Spent around 1.5 hours today.

**Thoughts:** Feel rusty and lacking confidence but happy to have the api call working, which was my stumbling block when I last worked on this project.

### Day 2: Wednesday 18/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Around 2 hours on Wikipedia Viewer. Prettied up the list with CSS transitions and put in full info.

**Thoughts:** Not as much as I hoped to finish but I have made some progress at least. Frustrated trying to center unordered list on the page.

### Day 3: Thursday 19/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Centered list successfully. Changes to CSS and optimised layout for mobile phone screens.

**Thoughts:** Tired after work and didn't get a lot done. Need to better plan out what I want to achieve.

### Day 4: Friday 20/04/18

**Today's Progress**: More Wikipedia Viewer. Played with CSS, and trying to change behaviour for mobile.

**Thoughts:** Hit a wall and now I'm confusing myself a bit. Time to leave it for today.

### Day 5: Saturday 21/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished behaviour for mobile screens, so now the css transition will show before you can follow the link, rather than the previous behaviour where the link would open in a new tab before the description is shown.

**Thoughts:** Glad I made time to work on this after a long day. Pretty happy with the result and I think I'm ready to move onto something else.

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on Udemy course "Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts"

**Thoughts:** Seems like it will be useful to get a deeper understanding of the language.

### Day 11: Friday 27/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Began working through Intermediate Algorithm Scripting on freecodecamp. Trying to make use of functional programming features such as filter function. Had difficulty figuring out why .every() worked in returning the correct value but .forEach() wouldn't. Think I have it figured now but need more work on understanding scope in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Need to stop being hard on myself if something doesn't click right away / I don't immediately find the solution. Part of learning is failing and trying another way.
