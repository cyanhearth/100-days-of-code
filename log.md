## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2016

### Day 1: Tuesday 17/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Returned to the FreeCodeCamp project *Build a Wikipedia Viewer*. Fixed the api call so that it now works correctly and display results in a list on the page. Spent around 1.5 hours today.

**Thoughts:** Feel rusty and lacking confidence but happy to have the api call working, which was my stumbling block when I last worked on this project.

### Day 2: Wednesday 18/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Around 2 hours on Wikipedia Viewer. Prettied up the list with CSS transitions and put in full info.

**Thoughts:** Not as much as I hoped to finish but I have made some progress at least. Frustrated trying to center unordered list on the page.

### Day 3: Thursday 19/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Centered list successfully. Changes to CSS and optimised layout for mobile phone screens.

**Thoughts:** Tired after work and didn't get a lot done. Need to better plan out what I want to achieve.
