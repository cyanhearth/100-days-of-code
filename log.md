## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2018

### Day 1: Tuesday 17/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Returned to the FreeCodeCamp project *Build a Wikipedia Viewer*. Fixed the api call so that it now works correctly and display results in a list on the page. Spent around 1.5 hours today.

**Thoughts:** Feel rusty and lacking confidence but happy to have the api call working, which was my stumbling block when I last worked on this project.

### Day 2: Wednesday 18/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Around 2 hours on Wikipedia Viewer. Prettied up the list with CSS transitions and put in full info.

**Thoughts:** Not as much as I hoped to finish but I have made some progress at least. Frustrated trying to center unordered list on the page.

### Day 3: Thursday 19/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Centered list successfully. Changes to CSS and optimised layout for mobile phone screens.

**Thoughts:** Tired after work and didn't get a lot done. Need to better plan out what I want to achieve.

### Day 4: Friday 20/04/18

**Today's Progress**: More Wikipedia Viewer. Played with CSS, and trying to change behaviour for mobile.

**Thoughts:** Hit a wall and now I'm confusing myself a bit. Time to leave it for today.

### Day 5: Saturday 21/04/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished behaviour for mobile screens, so now the css transition will show before you can follow the link, rather than the previous behaviour where the link would open in a new tab before the description is shown.

**Thoughts:** Glad I made time to work on this after a long day. Pretty happy with the result and I think I'm ready to move onto something else.

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on Udemy course "Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts"

**Thoughts:** Seems like it will be useful to get a deeper understanding of the language.
